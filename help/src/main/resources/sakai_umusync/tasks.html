<h2>How to Create/Edit/Delete tasks</h2>
	<p>In the page shown when entering to the sites synchronization tool there is a tasks list, and here we can make all the actions related to tasks.</p>
	<p>If we are in another page inside the tool, to return to that page we have to click on the option <i>Tasks</i> in the upper menu.</p>

<h3>Creating a new task</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Click on the option <i>New Task</i></li>
		<li>Fill in the new task form, consisting in the following fields:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Site type</strong>: It indicates the exact type of the site we want to synchronize, in the pick list the types defined in Sakai are shown, besides, the following options:
					<ul>
						<li><i>ALL</i>: It includes all the existing sites.</li>
						<li><i>Default user site</i>: In Sakai's default configuration, the site type for user sites isn't define, so the type <i>MyWorkspace</i> is not in the pick list, this option includes those user sites which don't have a defined type, for example the user's site <i>admin</i> is included</li>

						<li><i>sakai.properties</i>: The home page must have exactly the tools defined in the property for home pages of that type sites <i>wsetup.home.toolids.sitetype.*</i>, in case of not existing it checks the property for default sites: <a href="https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/DOC/sakai.properties+wsetup.*+(2.x)">wsetup.home.toolids.*</a></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
