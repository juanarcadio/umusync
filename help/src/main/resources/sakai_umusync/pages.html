<h2>How to Create/Edit/Delete pages</h2>
	<p>In the page that shows the pages list we can create, edit or delete pages.</p>
	<p>To enter we have to click on the option <i>Pages</i> in the upper menu.</p>

<h3>Create a new page</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Click on the option <i>New Page</i></li>
		<li>Set a name to the page (it can't be the same as another page name, or a tool identifier name)</li>
		<li>Set the layout, the page can have its tools in one or two columns. If the layout was in two columns and you change to one, the tools on the left column will be added at the end.</li>
		<li>To add a new too to the page we click on the pull-down menu where all Sakai's tools appear, we choose the one we want to add and click on the green cross icon, which inserts that tool at the end of the last (or single) column.</li>
		<li>Once the tool is added, we can reorder them as we want dragging the name to another column, or another position in the same column.</li>
		<li>Once we fill in the page data we click on the button <i>Save</i></li>
	</ol>

<h3>Edit a page</h3>
<p>The icon (pencil) in the first column of the pages list is used to edit them.</p>
<p>Notice that modifying pages can affect already created tasks using them.</p>

<h3>Delete a page</h3>
<p>The icon (red x) in the second column of the pages list is used to delete them.</p>
<p>Notice that deleting pages will also be deleted from those tasks using them.</p>
